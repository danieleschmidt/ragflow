# ADR-0002: Document Processing Pipeline Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
RAGFlow needs to process various document formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPT, HTML, Markdown, etc.) and extract meaningful content for retrieval-augmented generation. The document processing pipeline must handle:
- Multiple file formats with different parsing requirements
- Layout analysis and structure preservation
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for scanned documents
- Table and image extraction
- Metadata preservation
- Chunking strategies for optimal retrieval

## Decision
We will implement a modular document processing pipeline using the DeepDoc framework with the following architecture:

1. **Parser Layer**: Format-specific parsers for each document type
   - PDF Parser with layout analysis
   - Office document parsers (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX)
   - Text and markup parsers (TXT, MD, HTML)
   - Specialized parsers (Resume, Paper, Legal documents)

2. **Vision Layer**: Computer vision components for visual content
   - Layout recognition for document structure
   - OCR for text extraction from images
   - Table structure recognition
   - Image captioning for visual content

3. **Chunking Strategies**: Multiple approaches based on document type
   - Naive chunking for simple text
   - Semantic chunking for structured documents
   - Q&A extraction for FAQ-style content
   - Knowledge graph extraction for complex relationships

4. **Processing Pipeline**:
   ```
   Document → Format Detection → Parser Selection → Content Extraction 
   → Layout Analysis → Chunking → Embedding → Storage
   ```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Modular architecture allows easy addition of new parsers
- Specialized handling improves extraction quality
- Layout preservation maintains document context
- Multiple chunking strategies optimize retrieval accuracy
- Parallel processing capability for large document batches

### Negative
- Increased complexity in maintaining multiple parsers
- Higher computational requirements for vision components
- Storage overhead for preserving multiple representations
- Dependency on external libraries for specific formats

### Neutral
- Need for continuous parser updates as formats evolve
- Requirement for comprehensive testing across formats
- Trade-offs between processing speed and extraction quality

## Implementation Notes
- Use asyncio for parallel document processing
- Implement caching for processed documents
- Provide fallback parsers for unsupported formats
- Monitor parser performance and accuracy metrics
- Maintain compatibility matrix for supported formats
